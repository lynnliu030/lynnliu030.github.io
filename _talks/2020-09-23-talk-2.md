WACM has traditionally helped all CS students to be more prepared for their introductory CS courses by holding this workshop that teaches some of the basic Linux commands. Many CS students enrolled in 300-500 level courses typically find it useful to have someone walk through these commands. I am glad to be the presenter for this workshop for two years consecutively!
