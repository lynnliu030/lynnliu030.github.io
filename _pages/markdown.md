* I am a big fan of [FC Bayern](https://fcbayern.com/en) (since 2017!), and yes, I do play soccer, most of the time I play goalkeeper.  

* I can play the piano (started to learn when I was 4) and a little bit [Guzheng](https://www.seattleguzheng.com/history#:~:text=The%20guzheng%2C%20or%20gu%20zheng,and%20the%20Vietnamese%20%C4%91%C3%A0n%20tranh.) and [Hulusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi) which are all traditional Chinese instruments. (Btw, I am still on my way learning how to play guitar!) My favorite pianists are Vladimir Samoylovich Horowitz and Evgeny Kissin. 
* I am, proudly, a runner. I attended few running events like [The Color Run](https://thecolorrun.com/locations/madison/), [Light of the Moon Run](https://recwell.wisc.edu/lightofthemoon/), [Pi Mile Run](https://tbp.slc.engr.wisc.edu/events/pimilerun/index.html) and [Madison Marathon](https://www.madisonmarathon.org/) in 2019. I have registered for Madison Marathon 20', but that is canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic :(

* I love reading novels. My favorite novelists are Italo Calvino and Julio Cort√°zar. 
* I love photography! Take a look at the photos I took [here]().
