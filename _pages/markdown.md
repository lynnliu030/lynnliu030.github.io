* I am a big fan of [FC Bayern](https://fcbayern.com/en) (since 2017). Mia San Mia! 

* I am, proudly, a runner. I attended few running events like [The Color Run](https://thecolorrun.com/locations/madison/), [Light of the Moon Run](https://recwell.wisc.edu/lightofthemoon/), [Pi Mile Run](https://tbp.slc.engr.wisc.edu/events/pimilerun/index.html) and [Madison Marathon](https://www.madisonmarathon.org/) in 2019. Can't attend any running events in 2020, but hopefully things will get better in 2021! 

* I can play the piano and some other traditional Chinese instruments. Still on my way of learning Guitar... 

* I love reading novels :) My favorite novelists are Calvino, Cort√°zar, and Dostoevsky. Here is a list of books that I read in [Spr 21](https://sliu583.gitbook.io/reading-list/random/reading-list). 

* I'm a hobbyist photographer, take a look at the photos I took [here](https://lynnliu030.github.io/photography/)!
