Hi, this is Lynn :) I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science, Math and Statistics in L&S Honors Program at University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am now an undergrad research assistant in [WISR](https://wisr.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by Professor [Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/). My research interests lie in **system** and specifically its intersection with machine learning. 
 
Experience
-----
* **Activity Chair & Undergrad Representative @** [WACM](https://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/)
	* Previously, I taught workshops related to [Linux Basics](https://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/events.html) & [Machine Learning](https://github.com/lynnliu030/wacm-ml-workshop) to around 120-150 students, and hosted booths in Wisconsin Science Festival. I also helped with organizing workshops to teach young kids programming using the AppInventor platform. 
* **Undergrad Teaching Assistant @ [CS Dept](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), University of Wisconsin - Madison**
	* I was an undergrad TA for CS577 ([Intro to Algorithm](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shuchi/courses/577-S20/index.html)) in Spr 2020 and Summ 2020, and right now (Fall 2020) I am an undergrad TA for CS564 ([Database Management System](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/cs564-s18/)).
* **Undergrad Research Assistant @[ Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/)**
	* I am working with a wonderful group of people in the [Dairy Brain](https://dairybrain.wisc.edu/team/) project, an analytics platform that aggregates large quantities of data that are used to evaluate and predict the performance of dairy cows.  

Interest
-----
* I am a big fan of [FC Bayern](https://fcbayern.com/en) (since 2017!), and yes, I do play soccer, most of the time I play goalkeeper.  

* I can play the piano (started to learn when I was 4) and a little bit [Guzheng](https://www.seattleguzheng.com/history#:~:text=The%20guzheng%2C%20or%20gu%20zheng,and%20the%20Vietnamese%20%C4%91%C3%A0n%20tranh.) and [Hulusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi) which are all traditional Chinese instruments. (Btw, I am still on my way learning how to play guitar!) My favorite pianists are [Vladimir Samoylovich Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Horowitz) and [Evgeny Kissin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Kissin). 
* I am, proudly, a runner. I attended few running events like [The Color Run](https://thecolorrun.com/locations/madison/), [Light of the Moon Run](https://recwell.wisc.edu/lightofthemoon/), [Pi Mile Run](https://tbp.slc.engr.wisc.edu/events/pimilerun/index.html) and [Madison Marathon](https://www.madisonmarathon.org/) in 2019. I have registered for Madison Marathon 20', but that is canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic :(

* I love reading novels. My favorite novelists are [Italo Calvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino) and [Julio Cort√°zar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar). 
* I love photography! Take a look at the photos I took [here]().
