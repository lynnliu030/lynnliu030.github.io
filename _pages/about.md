Hi, this is Lynn :) I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science, Math and Statistics in L&S Honors Program at University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am now an undergrad research assistant in [WISR](https://wisr.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by Professor [Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/). My research interests lie in **system** and specifically its intersection with machine learning.
