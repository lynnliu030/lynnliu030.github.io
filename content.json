This lecture presents three ways of thinking about these systems. The “row method” focuses on the individual equations, the “column method” focuses on combining the columns, and the “matrix method” is an even more compact and powerful way of describing systems of linear equations.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"math","slug":"math","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/math/"},{"name":"linear algebra","slug":"linear-algebra","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/linear-algebra/"}]},{"title":"Creating Personal Blog Using Github + Hexo","slug":"Creating-Personal-Blog-Using-Github-Hexo","date":"2018-06-05T11:02:34.000Z","updated":"2018-06-06T22:35:41.538Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/05/Creating-Personal-Blog-Using-Github-Hexo/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/06/05/Creating-Personal-Blog-Using-Github-Hexo/","excerpt":"A brief guideline of creating a personal website.

IntroThis is my first blog :) In this article, I will record my process of creating a personal blogusing Github and Hexo. This approach could be used to create any websites, not just blog. I will also discuss about some problems I met with and the solutions I used during this process, which might be helpful for somebody who visits this website. Hope you enjoy the charm of creation. Outline Github Hexo (Node.js, Git) Website Creation Markdown Website Optimization Github Github Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a Github repository. If you don’t have a Github account, create one here! HexoWhat is Hexo? Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework; it’s also a static site generator. Click hexo website to get more information. InstallationWe’ll use Hexo to help us create our personal website. Click here to watch the video. Or you could just follow the steps below. We need to install a couple of things first. 1. Install Node.jsClick DownLoad_Nodejs to download Node.js. Or choose one of the links below. Windows Installer 32-bit Windows Installer 64-bit 2. Install GitClick git to download. Mac: See instruction in the hexo website. Webstie Optimization1. Add Favicon to Hexo Blog It depends on theme you’re using. Check theme documentation and the source. Here, I would like to introduce the way to change Favicon under the nexT theme. (note: Favicon means the website icon) The size of favicon could be 16x16, or 32x32. You could download the icon from any websites you like. There’re many websites that provide cute icons, such as fasticon, easyicon and so on. Notice, the picture must be the right size. Or you could use this Favicon Generator to convert your images into an icon favicon.ico. If you didn’t use the website above, please remember to change the name of your image to “favicon.ico”. Then, put this icon in /themes/next/source/images. Revise the file _config.yml inside the themes/next folder, as shown in the picture below. Notice: some problems I met with -&gt; it often takes a long time to change the website favicon, so just be patient and wait. Also, some icons are not so clear when they are set as the website favicon…… I haven’t come out with an idea 2. Text AlignmentProblem: It’s very weird when I type &#39; this; there’re a lot of space between two letters. It might be some problems with the text alignment. I put the problem here and I’ll come back later to discuss about the solutions.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"hexo","slug":"hexo","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/hexo/"},{"name":"github","slug":"github","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/github/"}]}]}
