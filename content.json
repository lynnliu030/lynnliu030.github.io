Try to keep them up to date. #IntroI started practicing doing some easy leetcode problems in 2018 summer. When I first started, without concerning about the time/space complexity, I came up with some … really stupid solutions. I record them here and I’ll review the problems &amp; solutions in the future. #Q&amp;A ##Question 21: Merge two sorted ListQ: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Example:Input: 1-&gt;2-&gt;4, 1-&gt;3-&gt;4 Output: 1-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;4 ###My solution: /** * Definition for singly-linked list. * public class ListNode { * int val; * ListNode next; * ListNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */ class Solution { public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) { if(l1 == null) // If the l1 is null, simply return l2 return l2; if(l2 == null) // If the l2 is null, return l1 return l1; ListNode mergeList = new ListNode(0); // create a new listNode to store the merge list ListNode headerNode = mergeList; // create a headerNode to record the first position in the list while(l1 != null || l2 != null){ // iterate through l1 and l2 if(l1 == null){ mergeList.next = l2; mergeList = mergeList.next; l2 = l2.next; } else if(l2 == null){ mergeList.next = l1; mergeList = mergeList.next; l1 = l1.next; } else if(l1.val &lt; l2.val){ mergeList.next = l1; mergeList = mergeList.next; l1 = l1.next; } else if(l1.val &gt;= l2.val){ mergeList.next = l2; mergeList = mergeList.next; l2 = l2.next; } } return headerNode.next; } }","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"leetcode","slug":"leetcode","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/leetcode/"}]},{"title":"Linear Algebra Learning Notes","slug":"Linear-Algebra-Learning-Notes","date":"2018-06-06T06:30:59.000Z","updated":"2018-10-31T23:54:07.055Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/06/Linear-Algebra-Learning-Notes/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/06/06/Linear-Algebra-Learning-Notes/","excerpt":"Brief notes of MIT open course Linear Algebra.

IntroThis is my first blog :) In this article, I will record my process of creating a personal blogusing Github and Hexo. This approach could be used to create any websites, not just blog. I will also discuss about some problems I met with and the solutions I used during this process, which might be helpful for somebody who visits this website. Hope you enjoy the charm of creation. Outline Github Hexo (Node.js, Git) Website Creation Markdown Website Optimization Github Github Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a Github repository. If you don’t have a Github account, create one here! HexoWhat is Hexo? Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework; it’s also a static site generator. Click hexo website to get more information. InstallationWe’ll use Hexo to help us create our personal website. Click here to watch the video. Or you could just follow the steps below. We need to install a couple of things first. 1. Install Node.jsClick DownLoad_Nodejs to download Node.js. Or choose one of the links below. Windows Installer 32-bit Windows Installer 64-bit 2. Install GitClick git to download. Mac: See instruction in the hexo website. Webstie Optimization1. Add Favicon to Hexo Blog It depends on theme you&amp;lsquore using. Check theme documentation and the source. Here, I would like to introduce the way to change Favicon under the nexT theme. (note: Favicon means the website icon) The size of favicon could be 16x16, or 32x32. You could download the icon from any websites you like. There’re many websites that provide cute icons, such as fasticon, easyicon and so on. Notice, the picture must be the right size. Or you could use this Favicon Generator to convert your images into an icon favicon.ico. If you didn’t use the website above, please remember to change the name of your image to “favicon.ico”. Then, put this icon in /themes/next/source/images. Revise the file _config.yml inside the themes/next folder, as shown in the picture below. Notice: some problems I met with -&gt; it often takes a long time to change the website favicon, so just be patient and wait. 2. Text AlignmentProblem: It’s very weird when I type &#39; this; there’re a lot of spaces between two letters.
