My first teaching assistant job in my sophomore year for CS 577 (Intro to Algorithm)! 

I was leading weekly discussions and review sessions based on lecture materials, attending weekly staff meeting and working with amazing professors to coordinate necessary support for students. I was also advising students during the individual help sessions, answering questions in Piazza and providing feedback. 

I really enjoyed hosting the weekly study group sessions and was thankful for many students (really!) who came to my session every week to practice extra problems. I myself learnt a lot in the process of explaining a difficult concept in a simple way and talking with students with struggles (just like me in the past!) in order to provide better support.
